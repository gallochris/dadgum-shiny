This is a Shiny app built for [dadgumboxscores.com](https://dadgumboxscores.com). It was built with the help of the Internet. 

The tool uses several R packages, including Shiny Dashboard, Readr, DT, and ggvis.

All data is from box scores via goheels.com and spreads via covers.com. If you have suggestions on how to improve it or make it better, I'm all ears.

###### What's in the app? 

Check the `app.R` file to see both the `ui.R` and `server.R`. 

The focus of this app is on game-by-game data, so it includes the following: 

- officials: a list of all refs for every game since '03-04
- four factors: game-by-game numbers of the building blocks of efficiency
- shooting data: game-by-game shooting stats since '03-04
- plots: some of this data can be used to generate charts or plots or graphs
